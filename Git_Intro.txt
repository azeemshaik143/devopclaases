Introduction to Git

VCS:- Version Control System
SCM:- Source Code Management

VCS:-
(1)LVCS:- Local Version Control System
(2)CVLS:- Centralized Version Control System
(3)DVCS:- Distributed Version Control System

Why need version control?

for collaboration
for storing
for figuring out what happened
for backup

Issues without version control:

*once saved, all the changes mode in the files are permanant and can't be revertback
*No record of what was done and by whom
*Downtime that can occur because of a faulty update could cost millions of losses

What is version control?
	Version control is a system that documents changes mode to a file or a set of files.It alllows 
multiple uses to manage multiple rivision of the same unit of information.It is a snapshot of your project.

Version Control Types:-

(1) LVC (Local Version Control):-
	
	*The practice of having the version database in the local computer.
	*Local database keeps a record of the changes made to files in version database.

Issue:- Multiple people parallelly working on the same project

Solution:- Centralized Version Control

(2) CVC (Centralized Version Control):-

	* Local version controls isssues are resolved by cvc
	* In cvc, a central repository is maintained where add the versioned files are kept
	* Now users can checkout, and check in files from their different computers at any time

Issue:- In case of central server failure whole system goes down

Solution:- Distributed Version Control

(3) DVC (Distributed Version Control):-
	*version database is stored ar every users local system and at the remote server.
	*users manipulate he local files and then upload the changes to the remote server.
	*If any of the servers die, a client server can be used to resolve

What is Git:-
	Git is an open source distributed version control system which records changes made to the files

Git Commands:-
	*git --version
	*git --help

* The remote repository is the server where all the collaborators upload changes made to the files
* The user modifies existing files and creates new files in this space. Git tracks these changes compared
  to your local repository
* workspace is users active directory
* Stage is a place where all the modified files marked to be comitted are placed
* Clone command create a copy of an existing remote repository inside the local repository
* push command pushes all the change made int the local repository to the remote repository
* pull like fetch, gets all the changes from the remote repository and copies them to the local repository
* pull merges those changes to the current working directory

.git:- when we clone the repository very first time we will find the two objects like .git folders and README.md which is optional
